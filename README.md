# python_game

This project was developed for the purpose of teaching children. Because of this, an iterative model is used here, so, you can see 16 steps, each of which improves upon the previous one. 

Some steps exist only to help children understand certain concepts. Like step2, where children can familiarize themselves with the window coordinate system and learn to create different shapes, and step3, where children learn how cycles are working for creating animations.

In step4, they learn how to control the movement of a shape from the keyboard. In step5, the area of movement of the figure is limited to the area of the window. In step6, they learn to change the shape's color depending on the condition. And in step7, they have the first versions of the game (light version for younger). Steps 8-16 continue the development of the game.

The purpose of this project explains the use of the simplest structures, the absence of division into modules, the avoidance of the use of classes and object-oriented programming, and the use of functions only in case of extreme necessity.
